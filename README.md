# RopeGame
Click on Gems in the right order to draw a rope between them.

To load game data from JSON, put JSON file called "level_data" in "Resources" folder. You can also name file whatever you want and change "File Name" in "LevelManager" "LoadFile".

It was difficult to see gem numbers, so I added black outline to them.

Unity version - 2020.3.20f1
